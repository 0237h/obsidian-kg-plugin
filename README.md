## Setup

1. **Get Your Private Key**: 
   - Visit [https://www.geobrowser.io/export-wallet](https://www.geobrowser.io/export-wallet)
   - Export your wallet's private key
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Keep this secure** - never share your private key!

2. **Configure the Plugin**:
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí Community Plugins ‚Üí Knowledge Graph Publisher
   - Enter your private key
   - Choose between Testnet (for testing) or Mainnet (for production)
   - Create or join a Knowledge Graph space

3. **Start Publishing**:
   - Use the ribbon icon to publish your current note
   - Use Command Palette: "Publish to Knowledge Graph"
   - Enable auto-publish for seamless integration

## Usage

### Publishing Notes

#### Single Note
- Click the Knowledge Graph icon in the ribbon
- Use `Ctrl+P` ‚Üí "Publish current note to Knowledge Graph"
- Right-click on a note ‚Üí "Publish to Knowledge Graph"

#### Bulk Publishing
- Use `Ctrl+P` ‚Üí "Publish all notes to Knowledge Graph"
- Configure excluded folders in settings to skip certain content

### Managing Spaces

#### Create a New Space
- Use `Ctrl+P` ‚Üí "Create new Knowledge Graph space"
- Enter a name and description
- The space will be deployed to the blockchain

#### Join an Existing Space
- Get an invite code from a space owner
- Use `Ctrl+P` ‚Üí "Join Knowledge Graph space"
- Enter the invite code

### Tag Management

The plugin automatically:
- Extracts hashtags from your notes
- Processes frontmatter tags
- Creates tag entities in the Knowledge Graph
- Establishes relationships between notes and tags

### Link Preservation

- Internal links (`[[Note Name]]`) become relations in the Knowledge Graph
- Backlinks are maintained and discoverable
- Embedded content relationships are preserved

## Configuration

### Settings Overview

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Network | Choose Testnet or Mainnet | Testnet |
| Private Key | Your wallet's private key | (empty) |
| Space ID | Your Knowledge Graph space | (empty) |
| Auto-publish | Publish changes automatically | false |
| Include Tags | Include note tags as entities | true |
| Include Links | Include note links as relations | true |
| Excluded Folders | Folders to skip during publishing | (empty) |

### Advanced Configuration

#### Custom API Endpoint
For advanced users, you can specify a custom API endpoint:
- Testnet: `https://hypergraph-v2-testnet.up.railway.app`
- Mainnet: `https://hypergraph-v2.up.railway.app`

#### Batch Processing
The plugin processes notes in batches to avoid overwhelming the network:
- Batch size: 10 notes per batch
- Delay between batches: 2 seconds
- Maximum retries: 3 per note

## How It Works

### The GRC-20 Protocol

The plugin uses the GRC-20 protocol to structure your knowledge:

1. **Entities**: Each note becomes an entity with properties like title, content, creation date
2. **Relations**: Links between notes become relations in the graph
3. **Properties**: Tags, metadata, and other attributes become entity properties
4. **Spaces**: Your knowledge is organized into collaborative spaces

### Data Flow

1. **Note Processing**: Extract content, tags, links, and metadata
2. **Entity Creation**: Transform notes into GRC-20 entities
3. **Relation Mapping**: Create relations between entities
4. **IPFS Storage**: Encode and store data on IPFS
5. **Blockchain Anchoring**: Record the IPFS hash on-chain
6. **Indexing**: The Graph's indexers process and expose your data

### Privacy and Security

- **End-to-End Encryption**: Your private spaces are encrypted
- **Selective Sharing**: Choose what to publish publicly or privately
- **Decentralized Storage**: No single point of failure
- **Blockchain Verification**: Immutable record of contributions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "No space configured"
- Ensure you've set a valid Space ID in settings
- Create a new space if you don't have one
- Verify the space exists and you have access

#### "Invalid private key"
- Check that your private key starts with "0x"
- Ensure the key is from your Geo wallet
- Never share your private key with anyone

#### "Network connection failed"
- Check your internet connection
- Verify the API endpoint is correct
- Try switching networks (testnet/mainnet)

#### "Transaction failed"
- Ensure you have sufficient funds for gas fees
- Check that your wallet has the necessary permissions
- Verify the space allows new contributions
